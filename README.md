# Early-Prediction-for-Chronic-Kidney-Disease-Detection-A-Progressive-Approach-to-Health-Management
Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is a major medical problem and can be cured if treated in the early stages. Usually, people are not aware that medical tests we take for different purposes could contain valuable information concerning kidney diseases. Consequently, attributes of various medical tests are investigated to distinguish which attributes may contain helpful information about the disease. The information says that it helps us to measure the severity of the problem, the predicted survival of the patient after the illness, the pattern of the disease and work for curing the disease.

Scenario 1: Early Detection through Routine Tests
A patient visits a clinic for a routine health check-up. The doctor analyzes standard blood and urine test results, which reveal abnormal creatinine and albumin levels. These indicators help detect CKD at an early stage, enabling timely treatment to prevent disease progression.

Scenario 2: Predicting Disease Severity and Survival

A hospital uses AI to analyze historical patient data. For a newly diagnosed CKD patient, the system predicts disease severity and potential survival outcomes based on test attributes like GFR, hemoglobin, and serum creatinine. This helps doctors plan targeted treatment strategies

Scenario 3: Monitoring Disease Progression

A CKD patient undergoes regular follow-up tests. The system tracks changes in key biomarkers over time to monitor disease progression. If the system detects worsening patterns, it alerts the physician to adjust the treatment plan, reducing the risk of kidney failure.
